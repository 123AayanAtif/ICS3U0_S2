# this is a code comment
name = "Leslie"
print("Hello", name)

# Predict: What I think will happen is that the code will show up with the name provided in the "name = 'insert name'" box. It will then output "'Hello', Leslie"

# Run: What I predicted would happen was about true 

# Inspect: If I wanted to add a comma to this code, I would need to add a comma right beside the "Hello" in the text. For example "("Hello," name)

# Modify:
# this is a code comment
name = "Aayan Atif."
print("Hello,", name)

# This modification in the code will print "Hello, Aayan Atif."

# Roles of the variables in python: The variable name is a string that atores the inputted name, which is then utilized to print something like "Hello Name".
