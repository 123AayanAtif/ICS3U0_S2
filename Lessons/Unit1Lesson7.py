# Predict: I predict that the code will output "Please input a whole number:" then it will wait for a user input. 
# Once the user inputs a number I predict that it will output "Please input another nonzero whole number" and wait for the user input.
# My last prediction for this code will be that it will think if the second input is a factor of the first input and display if it is a factor, but it wont display if it isnt a factor because the code isnt capable to tell the user if it isnt a factor.

# Run: My prediction was correct, when I ran a number like 10 and 1, it was able to tell me that 1 is a factor of 10, but when I ran 3 and 10, it kept thinking and not showing any output. 
# Inspect: Yes, the output matched what I did on my calculator.
