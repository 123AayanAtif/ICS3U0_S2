# Task A: My prediction is that it will output:
# Welcome to Sanjay's Koala Party!
# It's possible Sanjay can distribute  12
# cookies for each bowl.

# When running the program, I found that my prediction was correct.

# Fix the program so that there is only one space before and after the "12":
print("Welcome to Sanjay's Koala Party!")
print("It's possible Sanjay can distribute", 12)
print("cookies for each bowl.")

# Task B:
print("Sanjay has", 6, "bowls for", 144, "cookies")
# You can also do,
print("Sanjay has %d bowls for %d cookies" % (6, 144))

# Task C:
print("The number of cookies per bowl is:", 144/6)

# One text value and one numeric value (result of dividing two numbers using /)
